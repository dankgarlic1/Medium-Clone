    content:
      "Gym motivation is a myth. I’ve spent more time convincing myself to go to the gym than actually working out. I’ll have elaborate plans of hitting the gym every day, only to find myself sprawled on the couch with a pizza in hand. And don’t get me started on the gym selfies – because nothing screams ‘I’m working out’ like taking a photo in front of the mirror. Despite all my procrastination and half-hearted attempts, there’s something oddly satisfying about the post-workout soreness. It’s a reminder that, despite my reluctance, I’m doing something vaguely productive. So here’s to the reluctant gym rats who struggle with motivation but still show up, even if it’s just to avoid feeling guilty later.",
